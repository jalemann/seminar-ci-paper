This paper aims to deliver an overview over voting mechanisms used in reinforcement learning.
Voting mechanisms are first introduced to the reader and then explained in more detail by
describing usage examples and experiments from current research.

\section{Introduction}
In multi-agent settings there are a number of mechanisms that allow for interaction between several agents.
One of these mechanisms is voting which enables a distributed decision process where multiple agents decide on which actions to take.
\newline
However designing a voting mechanism is non-trivial since the voting system has to consider different aspects like security, fairness and robustness.
Arrow's Impossibility Theorem even states that voting mechanisms cannot be designed to be completely fair.
Ongoing research constantly tries to improve the security, robustness and fairness of voting mechanisms.
\newline
To give an overview over voting mechanisms in reinforcement learning Section \ref{2BasicPrinciples} introduces basic principles and constraints of voting systems.
Section \ref{3RelatedWork} describes related work to highlight use cases of voting mechanisms in reinforcement learning as well as ongoing research trying to improve such mechanisms.

% BASIC PRINCIPLES
    % Tell the readers about definitions, foundations that are used
\section{Basic Priniciples}\label{2BasicPrinciples}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Robert's Rules of Order (Newly Revised) (RONR)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Set of rules for voting procedure
    \end{itemize}
    \item Arrow's Impossibility Theorem
    \begin{itemize}
        \item states that no rank-order electorial system can be designed to be perfectly fair matching these criterias:
        \item If every voter prefers alternative X over alternative Y, then the group prefers X over Y.
        \item If every voter’s preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then the group’s preference between X and Y also remains unchanged.
        \item There is no “dictator”: no single voter possesses the power to always determine the group’s preference.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
