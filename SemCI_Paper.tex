\section{Introduction}
In a democratic society choices are not made by a dictator but by taking the preferences of the whole society into account. Therefore each member of the society is entitled to cast a vote which represents it's preferences. Votes are then evaluated and a decision is derived by a given voting scheme. Plurality where the choice with the most votes wins, might be the most common voting scheme. Still there are many different voting schemes each of which can or cannot fulfil certain properties. This lies mainly in the subject of social choice theory and therefore is only described briefly if needed in the following.
\newline
The concept of considering multiple individuals' preferences by using a voting mechanism to make choices can be transferred to multi-agent reinforcement learning systems. This is motivated by the expectation that agents combine their limited perception and knowledge of the environment by deciding together. Therefore they are expected to obtain better results than agents that choose actions based on only their own perception.\cite{partalas2008hybrid}
\newline
Since learning agents try to optimise their own reward, they might learn to act selfish\cite{carr2008peer} or even learn to use strategic voting to exploit the voting system\cite{pitt2006voting} for that purpose.
Thus the design of a voting mechanism incorporated in a multi-agent reinforcement learning system is non-trivial.
To avoid extensive selfish behaviour in agents several constraints can be introduced by modifying the reward function or voting system.
The possibility to exploit a voting system depends on the chosen voting scheme.
Unfortunately Arrow's Impossibility Theorem implies that no voting scheme can be designed to be completely fair. This means there is always a way in which agents could exploit such a voting scheme by finding a certain voting strategy. Arrow's Impossibility Theorem will be explained later on in Section \ref{2BasicPrinciples}.
\newline
To give an overview over voting schemes and their possible properties Section \ref{2BasicPrinciples} introduces basic principles of social choice theory as far as they are required to understand the concepts described later on.
Section \ref{3RelatedWork} then shows related work to give example  applications of voting mechanisms incorporated in reinforcement learning.
Additionally used methods to avoid exploitation or selfish behaviour of agents will be highlighted.
As a conclusion different applications of voting mechanisms in multi-agent reinforcement learning settings are briefly compared in Section \ref{4Conclusion}.

% BASIC PRINCIPLES
    % Tell the readers about definitions, foundations that are used
\section{Basic Priniciples}\label{2BasicPrinciples}
The following gives an introduction to basic principles of social choice theory that are needed to understand the concepts described in \ref{3RelatedWork}.
% Voting Schemes
\subsection{Different Voting Schemes}
To discuss properties of voting systems we have to introduce those systems first.

% Properties of Voting Schemes
\subsection{Properties of Voting Schemes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Pareto efficiency}:\\
    If every voter prefers option X over option Y, then the society prefers X over Y.
    \item \textit{Independence of irrelevant alternatives}:\\
    If every voter prefers option X over option Y and option Z is removed without changing the former relation, the societies preference of X over Y also remains unchanged.
    \item \textit{Non-dictatorship}:\\
    No single voter posseses the power to always determine the group's preference.
\end{itemize}

% Arrow's Impossibility Theorem
\subsection{Theorems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Arrow's Impossibility Theorem}\cite{arrow2012social}:\\
    Arrow's Impossibility Theorem states that no rank-order voting scheme can fulfil the properties Pareto efficiency, independece of irrelevant alternatives and non-dictatorship at the same time.
    Meaning that every voting scheme can be exploited by strategic voting.\cite{pitt2006voting}
\end{itemize}
